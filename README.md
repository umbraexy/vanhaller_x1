# vanhaller_x1
Vanhaller_X1 is a Powershell script I wrote before I learned about netstat -naob (which works similarly). 
Upon execution, it will build a table containing the state of a TCP port (listening/established), the # of the port, and the owning process for that particular port.
Outputs to a .txt file for easy visualization of processes currently running on established/listening ports.
