# vanhaller_x1
Vanhaller_X1 is a Powershell script I wrote before I learned about netstat -naob (which works similarly). 
Upon execution, it will build a table containing the state of all listening/established TCP ports, the # of the ports, and the owning processes for those particular ports.
Outputs to a .txt file for easy visualization of processes currently running on established/listening ports.

NOTE: It may take a few seconds for the script to complete its full execution.
